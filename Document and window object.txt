The document and window objects are fundamental in web development, each serving distinct roles.
The window object represents the browser window, acting as the global context for all JavaScript code.
It encompasses properties and methods for controlling the browser environment, such as alert(), setTimeout(), and location.
All global variables and functions in JavaScript are properties of the window object. For instance, when you declare var x = 10;, it is equivalent to window.x = 10;.
The document object represents the HTML content within the window.
It provides methods and properties to interact with and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), such as getElementById(), createElement(), and querySelector().
It provides information about the document itself, such as document.title for the title of the webpage, document.URL for the current URL, and document.cookie for managing cookies.
While window is the overarching environment, document is specifically for content manipulation.
Together, they form the foundation of dynamic, interactive web applications.
